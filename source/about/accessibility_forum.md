Hosted by arXiv, this half-day online forum will center the experiences of academic researchers with disabilities who face barriers to accessing and reading papers. The forum will be useful for people across the academic publishing pipeline who are committed to accessibility and want to collaborate on solutions. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.

We will walk away from this forum having learned three things:

1. That accessibility is a known problem with known solutions.
1. That we are far behind.
1. And that we can do it! There are a lot of resources and smart people working on solutions. And those solutions can be relatively easy.

We want to make this forum as inclusive as we can. *Please note that STEM-literate ASL interpreters will be present throughout all segments.* Please let us know in the registration form if additional accommodations would help you participate fully.

### Presentations
We, the community, know the issues of accessibility. And we know the solutions, too. In this segment researchers who directly face barriers to accessing papers will share the obstacles they face and the solutions that work for them. We will ask: How can these personal solutions become global and part of the culture?

List of presenters to be announced soon.

### Panel Discussion
Topic: Where in the pipeline do we need to change? Whose responsibility is it to make content accessible?

Panel participants to be announced soon.

### Breakout Groups to dig deeper
Dig deeper into topical discussions, share solutions, and help one anotherâ€™s efforts. Topical breakout rooms will cover specific technical subjects and more. We hope to hear your suggestions in the registration form.
